        <p> It's...it's a dinosaur... Hold onto your butts. Boy, do I hate being right all the time. Remind me to thank John for the wonderful weekend. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should. Well, at least you're out of the tree. I can't get <a href="http://www.jurassicworld.com/" target="_blank">Jurassic Park</a> back online without Dennis Nedry. It's a Unix system, I know this!</p>
